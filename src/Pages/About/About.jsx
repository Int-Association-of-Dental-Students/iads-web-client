A committee consisting of representatives from Denmark, Holland and the UK was formed to build the constitution of the Association. This constitution was drafted and the first Executive Committee was elected; Leslie Sorling from Sweden being the first President, with Mogens Skougaard from Denmark, Secretary and Carlo Nevejan from Holland, Treasurer. The encouragement and advice of Prof.P. O. Pedersen through his great knowledge of the affairs of the FDI, was invaluable - making him the first Honorary Life Member of IADS. ",

        "The 1955 Annual Congress was held in Malmo and this was followed by those in Newcastle, Oslo, Ghent, Berlin, Stockholm, London, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam and London again in 1965. Only in 1963, due to late cancellation, was there no Congress. During this time the membership increased to fifteen countries and the Association had become well established in the dental world. The Annual Congress had become a most enjoyable, although mainly social, gathering; it provided almost the only communication between members as the finances of the Association precluded circularised publications. However, the exchange program had become established and this international exchange of dental students has continued to be a most worthwhile and successful project and one of which the IADS can be justly proud.",

        "An IADS Congress was held outside Europe for the first time in its history; in Jerusalem. Incidentally, this meeting was my first introduction to the IADS and was the first of the ten Congresses which it has been my privilege to attend said Peter Swiss (IADS Legendary Alumni).This Congress also marked the transition of the IADS from that of a young association to a mature one tackling present problems and planning for a successful future. A recruitment drive in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and North America was therefore initiated and a newsletter with commercial sponsorship was planned. The increasing volume and complexity of business to be considered by the General Assembly made it essential that this be conducted in a well-ordered and democratic manner, presided over by an independent Chairperson.",

      cardDetailedText:
        "Berlin was host to the IADS for the second time in 1970 and at this Congress, Mr. Mark-John Vella-Bardon urged that discussion groups should replace formal lectures as the major content of the Scientific Program. The success of these groups was noticed by the FDI. As a result, in 1973, the FDI Commissions on Dental Education, Dental Practice and Public Dental Health each invited the IADS to appoint a representative to participate in their Commission meetings at the FDI Congresses.",

      cardTitle: "Importance of Sponsorship",
      cardDetailedText:
        "The Congress of 1979 was set in the beautiful city of Freiburg, West Germany. It was however a conference beset by management problems due partly to failure of the CoCo, to appreciate the importance of sponsorship in a congress of such size. Successive CoCos have realized the necessity of gaining help from commercial sources a daunting and difficult task, but one which has been tackled, is some cases, by hard-nosed business acumen. One of the main areas of difficulty, about which I felt strongly, was that of a constitution which seemed to slow down proceedings and often caused the General Assembly to come to a virtual standstill over a procedural point. Valuable debating time was often lost.",
