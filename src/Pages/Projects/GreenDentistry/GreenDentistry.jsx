          History
        </h1>
        <p className="sec-txt" style={{ width: "80%", margin: "auto" }}>
          Green Dentistry started as a joint project between IADS and FVDZ in
          2020, under the leadership of Prophylaxis Chairperson, Julien Issa.
          Aiming to raise awareness for a relatively budding yet contemporary
          concern as is the safety of our environment and our footprint as
          dental professionals, the project quickly gained interest among
          national organisations among several of our member countries and was
          transformed into one of IADS major public health campaigns. <br />
          Now, both organisations celebrate Green Dentistry Day on May 22nd,
          along with several other countries that join the campaigning and each
          year a competition for best campaign is held as the reach of this
          project grows bigger. <br />
          In November 2021, FVDZ representative, and in this case our
          representative as well, Milena Hegenauer presented the Green Dentistry
          Day project at COP26, showing work that was done so far through
          campaigns and showcasing the work of the winning organisation of 2021
          under the auspices of IADS, the Sudanese Association of Dental
          Students (SADS).
